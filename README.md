# Awm dots

New repo for my older dots on Awesome. I'm actually on Swayfx and it made a lot
of breaking change with my previous stack so rather than create a branch, i
prefer to create a clean and new repository to organize things.

## Setup

- **Wm**: awesome
- **Compositor**: picom
- **Terminal**: xst
- **Program launcher**: dmenu
- **Music player**: mpd, ncmpcpp
- **Lock screen**: betterlockscreen

## Thanks to old fork (+5 years)
